# Booking System User-Passenger Alignment

## 🎯 Overview

The booking system has been updated to automatically include the user who makes the booking as a passenger, ensuring that every booking has at least one passenger and the user is always included in their own bookings.

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Automatic User Inclusion**
- **Before**: Users had to manually add themselves to the passengers list
- **After**: The booking user is automatically added as the first passenger
- **Logic**: Check if user is already in passengers list, if not, add them automatically

### 2. **User Data Integration**
- **User Fields Used**: `first_name`, `last_name`, `nationality`, `date_of_birth`
- **Age Calculation**: Automatically calculated from `date_of_birth`
- **Fallback Values**: Uses "Unknown" and "User" if name fields are empty

### 3. **Passenger Entity Enhancement**
- **New Field**: `is_user` boolean field to identify the booking user
- **Default**: `false` for additional passengers, `true` for the booking user
- **Index**: Added for better query performance

### 4. **Booking Creation Flow**

```typescript
// New booking creation logic:
1. Fetch user data (name, nationality, date of birth)
2. Check if user is already in passengers list
3. If not, add user as first passenger with isUser = true
4. Add additional passengers from DTO with isUser = false
5. Validate seat availability
6. Create booking and passengers in transaction
```

### 5. **Database Migration**
```sql
-- Add is_user column to passengers table
ALTER TABLE passengers ADD COLUMN is_user BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
CREATE INDEX idx_passengers_is_user ON passengers(is_user);
```

## 🔄 Updated API Behavior

### **Create Booking Endpoint** (`POST /bookings`)

**Request Examples:**

1. **User books for themselves only:**
```json
{
  "dealId": 1,
  "totalPrice": 1500.00,
  "onboardDining": true
}
```
**Result**: User automatically added as passenger

2. **User books for themselves + others:**
```json
{
  "dealId": 1,
  "totalPrice": 3000.00,
  "passengers": [
    {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "age": 25,
      "nationality": "US"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Result**: User + John Doe as passengers

3. **User books for others (user already in list):**
```json
{
  "dealId": 1,
  "totalPrice": 1500.00,
  "passengers": [
    {
      "firstName": "John", // Same as user's first_name
      "lastName": "Smith", // Same as user's last_name
      "age": 30,
      "nationality": "US"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Result**: Only John Smith as passenger (no duplicate)

## 📊 Benefits

### **For Users:**
- ✅ No need to manually add themselves as passengers
- ✅ Automatic passenger creation from profile data
- ✅ Consistent booking experience
- ✅ Reduced form complexity

### **For System:**
- ✅ Guaranteed passenger list (never empty)
- ✅ Clear identification of booking user
- ✅ Better data consistency
- ✅ Improved query performance with indexes

### **For Business:**
- ✅ Accurate passenger counts
- ✅ Better seat management
- ✅ Clear audit trail
- ✅ Simplified booking flow

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Key Methods Added:**

1. **`calculateAge(dateOfBirth: Date): number`**
   - Calculates age from date of birth
   - Handles month/day edge cases

2. **Enhanced `create()` method**
   - Fetches user data
   - Validates user existence
   - Prepares passenger list with user inclusion
   - Creates passengers with `isUser` flag

### **Database Changes:**
- `passengers.is_user` column (boolean, default false)
- Index on `is_user` for performance
- Backward compatible with existing data

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### **Test Cases:**

1. **User books solo** → User added as passenger
2. **User books with others** → User + others as passengers
3. **User already in passengers list** → No duplicate
4. **User with missing name data** → Fallback values used
5. **User with date of birth** → Age calculated automatically

### **Edge Cases Handled:**
- User not found → 404 error
- Insufficient seats → 400 error
- Duplicate user in passengers → No duplicate created
- Missing user name fields → Fallback values

## 📋 Migration Steps

1. **Run Database Migration:**
```bash
# Execute the SQL migration
mysql -u username -p database_name < add-is-user-to-passengers.sql
```

2. **Deploy Updated Code:**
   - Updated `BookingsService.create()` method
   - Updated `Passenger` entity
   - Updated `CreateBookingDto` documentation

3. **Verify Functionality:**
   - Test booking creation with various scenarios
   - Verify user is always included as passenger
   - Check `is_user` flag is set correctly

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Flutter App Updates:**
   - Update booking forms to reflect new behavior
   - Remove requirement for user to add themselves
   - Update UI to show user as first passenger

2. **Additional Features:**
   - Passenger management (edit/remove passengers)
   - User profile completion prompts
   - Passenger preferences storage

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Track booking success rates
   - Monitor passenger count accuracy
   - Analyze user booking patterns

## 📝 API Documentation Updates

### **CreateBookingDto.passengers**
- **Type**: `PassengerDataDto[]` (optional)
- **Description**: Additional passengers (the booking user will be automatically added as the first passenger if not already included)
- **Default**: Empty array (user only)

### **Response Enhancement**
- **Timeline Event**: Includes `userIncluded` flag in metadata
- **Passenger Count**: Always includes the booking user
- **Seat Validation**: Based on total passengers (user + additional)

This alignment ensures that every booking has a complete passenger list with the user always included, providing a more intuitive and reliable booking experience.
